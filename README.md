# Abstract
This project presents the development of a Java-based inventory and procurement management system tailored for SIGMA SDN BHD, a wholesale distributor in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. The system automates core operations such as item and supplier management, daily sales entry, purchase requisition, and purchase order processing. Implemented using object-oriented principles, the system supports role-based access for admins, sales managers, and purchase managers, ensuring secure and structured workflows. Features include data validation, stock alerts, and CRUD functionalities with a file-based data storage mechanism. UML diagrams, sample outputs, and extensive use case documentation demonstrate the system's design and functionality. Despite certain limitations, such as static data capacity and lack of real-time updates, the system enhances operational efficiency and provides a solid foundation for future scalability.
